kids sneaking into movie theaters
rogue-like ish
goal is to sneak into as many movies in a year as they can
control group of kids or something, like 4 maybe but can recruit more?
stealth/gadget-using gameplay

can have game overs but at the end it's revealed that the mom of one of the kids in the group is the owner of the movie place and they were allowed to watch as many movies as they want the whole time


when you get a game over it should be like "NO NO NO NO THAT won't work!" and like flashback to the kids planning as if the whole gameplay was them trying to plan out everything. In this way, the "true timeline" by the end of the game has the kids not getting caught at all and then the reveal of "actually, there wasn't really security" would happen
