# A Day at the Movies

A 3D stealth game made in Rust using the awesome [Bevy engine][bevy]. It can be played [here][itch].

This game was made in a week as a submission for the [Rusty Jam][rustyjam] game jam. Check out and rate the submissions [here](submissions)!

There is *a lot* that can be improved in this code base and I strongly advise anyone wanting to learn from this code to keep the above in mind. Again, this project was made in just 7 days, so a lot of shortcuts were taken.

I'm always hanging out in the [bevy discord][bevy-discord], definitely feel free to @ramirezmike me and ask questions or criticize me :)

Also, feel free to fork/make issues!
